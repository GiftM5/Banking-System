# Banking-System

Objectives
1. Create a robust and secure backend API to handle banking operations like creating accounts, deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks.
2. Learn and implement Flask concepts such as routing, request handling, and error handling.
3. Incorporate basic database operations using SQLAlchemy or another database library.
4. Test the API endpoints with tools like Postman.
5. Ensure the API is well-documented and secure.

Key Points to Focus On:
• Flask Basics: Understand routing, request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and creating RESTful APIs
.
• Database Integration: Use SQLite or PostgreSQL with Flask-SQLAlchemy.

• Security: Implement input validation, secure passwords with hashing, and ensure secure database queries to prevent SQL injection.

• API Testing: Learn to test your endpoints using tools like Postman or Swagger.

• Frontend Interaction: Design your API with the intent of connecting it to the HTML and CSS frontend.


Step-by-Step Plan

Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

• Install Python (if not already installed).

• Set up a virtual environment.

• Install Flask: pip install flask.

• Install Flask-SQLAlchemy for database interaction: pip install flask-sqlalchemy.

Step 2: Learn Flask Basics

• Understand how to set up a Flask app.

• Learn routing (@app.route), and how to create, read, update, and delete data via API endpoints.

• Practice returning JSON responses.

Step 3: Design Your API

• Define the API functionality:

• Endpoints:

• /create_account: To create new accounts.

• /deposit: To deposit money.

• /withdraw: To withdraw money.

• /balance: To fetch account balances.

• Decide the data structure for user accounts.

• Sketch out the API using a tool like Swagger or write down the API specifications.

Step 4: Build Database Models

• Use Flask-SQLAlchemy to define models:

• Users: Name, email, password.

• Accounts: Account number, balance.

• Transactions: Amount, type (deposit/withdrawal), timestamp.

• Learn how to perform CRUD operations.

Step 5: Implement Core API Logic

• Write functions to handle:

• Creating accounts.

• Validating and processing deposits and withdrawals.

• Fetching balances.

• Use error handling to catch invalid operations (e.g., insufficient funds).

Step 6: Test Your API

• Install Postman and test each endpoint.

• Validate inputs and outputs for various scenarios.

Step 7: Add Security

• Hash passwords using libraries like bcrypt.

• Validate inputs to prevent attacks like SQL injection.

• Learn about authentication (basic token-based authentication for now).

Step 8: Documentation
• Add clear documentation for your API endpoints, either manually or using tools like Swagger.

Step 9: Connect to Frontend
• Use your API with HTML and CSS by making AJAX calls (optional for now; focus on backend first).
